# Exercise-Logger-Project

This project was for my PHP with MySQL class. 

The objectives were:

- A function that calculates the numbers of calories burned (Formula was taken from http://www.shapesense.com/fitness-exercise/calculators/heart-rate-based-calorie-burn-calculator.shtml)
- Ability to have multiple users
- Edit Profile page to edit the users profile
- Log Exercise Page to add exercise logs to the users account
- View Profile Page to view the users profile along with the 15 lastest exercises
